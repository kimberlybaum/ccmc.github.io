      <h2>The Concrete Cowboys</h2>

      <p class="pText">
          As the iconic cowboy is to the American west, so are these adorable urbanites to the vibrant city they inhabit. All at the vanguard of the art scene in Solana City, they’ve joined to form the Concrete Cowboy MetaCollective, a close-knit group of NFT collectors and creators, in order to appreciate others’ art, showcase their own, and party with friends old & new. Each lives in a stylish flat, where they host parties to show off their decor and display their art collections. Sometimes they enjoy Solana City’s nightlife a little too much, but they never return home without a new connection and a deeper place in their community.

            While using a scalable, proof of stake blockchain in Solana can do a lot to reduce the negative environmental impact of generating tokens, we are excited to announce our partnership with Aerial, a company who offsets the carbon emissions with each purchase.

          <h2>The CCMC World</h2>
          <p class="pText">
  
              We plan to build a social MMO RPG powered by the Solana Blockchain, with each Concrete Cowboy providing the entry to this virtual world. Our world provides the unique ability to showcase your NFTs purchased by any cryptocurrency, in your own MetaCollective apartment. Users are only able to showcase nfts that we verify are owned by them, so you know you’re seeing the original. Leaderboards will show the top nft galleries, 
              Players will also be able to explore the bars and clubs of this virtual city, play board games with friends in Concrete Cowboy Coffee shops, and participate in airdrops you can only receive in-game. The goal of the project will be to develop a diverse community of people united by a common enthusiasm for blockchain technology and art, allowing them to form new connections and grown their community.
          </p> 
  
          <p>
              We grew up playing Club Penguin, Webkinz, and RuneScape. As adults, we’ve been engrossed by blockchain technology and all it’s potential to revolutionize the world. We found that as we collected NFTs on the Solana blockchain over the last few months, we didn’t have an outlet to meet with friends, display our Solana NFTs, look at friends’ collections, and bond with new people over our shared enthusiasm. We plan to provide an exclusive metaverse to act as a hub for NFT appreciation, sharing, exchange, and donation just for fanatics like us. We will work to build a strong community and a complex world around it, making it more than just a set of galleries to walk around in. The world will also have games, coffee shops, bars, clubs, and galleries sponsored by the Collective itself. Gain a following of people who appreciate your NFTs, and climb the leaderboard as you accumulate a stronger and stronger collection. Conceptualize, create, and mint your own new NFTs with friends in the Collective’s art studio. Participate in members-only events to vie for rare airdrops & merch.
          </p>
  
  
          <p>
              We also realized we didn’t want to exclude people with Ethereum NFTs from fully showcasing their collections to the community. That’s why we’re building cross-platform NFT recognition, so that you can hang not just your Solana art on the wall, but all your art. This will provide a richer, more accessible experience to a larger portion of the blockchain community. 
            </p>
  
          
            <p>
            We’ve begun assembling a team with professional experience in art design, blockchain and web development, game design, operations, and community marketing and outreach. We want to bring even more people on board to bring our ambitious vision to life, and we will reinvest our profits from the initial drop into making that happen.
